## Main goal
Develop a mini-game launcher and 2 simple mini-games for tests. <br>
A special feature of the task is that all data and assets from the games must be on the server and downloaded / unloaded from the user's device at the request of the user himself.<br> 
The most important thing in the task is to create a flexible system for loading and unloading mini-game resources.<br> 
Main Menu: There are 2 buttons that are clicked to launch the selected game. Also, each such button has 2 more buttons on which you can download / delete the content of the mini-game.<br> 
Game 1: The 1st game is a simple clicker. A picture that you can click on and get 1 point. The number of clicks on the image is saved between sessions and also after unloading the game from memory.<br>
Game 2: The 2nd game is a simple walker from point A to point B. There is a 3D model of the main character and also a model of the finish. When the hero collides with the finish line, we get a victory window in which the current time for which it was completed and the best result are recorded. The best result should also be preserved between sessions and when unloading resources.<br>
